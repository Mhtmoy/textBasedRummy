Testing Plan

1. Correct number of cards should be dealt to each player, depending on number
of players
2. player should be able to draw card from either pile and the card should appear in their hand.
3. Player should be able to play on excisting melds.
  - card should be checked to see if it can be played
    - if yes play card. add card to meld and remove card from hand
    - if no do not do anything
4. player can make meld
  - cards should be checked if they can be played together
    - if yes all cards selected should be added to the meld and the cards should be removed from the hand.
    if no dont do anything
5. Player discards cards. card should be removed from hand and added to discard pile

Bug: games crashes when input is char


Game Controller constructor
  mock view so game opening returns 2 players
  create a mock deck
  make sure correct number of cards dealt to players

game Controller pickUpLogic
  test if userselection is 1 that player gains a card and a card is erased from deck
  test if userselection isnt 1 that player gains card and a card is taken from
    discard and that discard flag = true

GameController discardCheckLogic
  test if discard flag is true that the function returns false
  test if discard flag is false that the function returns true
  test after the functions ran the discardflag is false

GameController discardLogic
  check that card is added to discard pile
  check that card is removed from hand

GameController meldAddLogic
  check that cards is added to the meld
  check that cards is removed from player hand
  check returns true if card can be added to meld
